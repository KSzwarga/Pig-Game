# Pig-Game

The game was created as a part of Udemy Course. The player rolls the dice, the points from the dice rolls are accumulated in the current pool. The player can choose to hold and add the points from current pool to his score and switch turn to the other player. If the dice rolls 1 the points in the current pool are lost (but not those that have been added to score through holding) and the game switches to the other player. The game is won by the player who first scored 100 points.
